# IARC/CSU github Dataviz webpage

Welcome to the CSU dataviz gallery, a webpage listing all graphics and datavisualization made by the [Cancer Surveillance Unit][https://www.iarc.who.int/branches-csu]. 

The repository is maintained by Mathieu Laversanne and Frédéric LAM.
Github.io url is https://iarc-csu.github.io/DataVisualization. 

Please ask CSU team in case you want to contribute or have any enquiry. 

Each project below has it's own context, using plain html/javascript/css sometimes, VueJS other time, and of course d3js library most of the time. So the purpose of subfolders is to isolate each peace of interactive graphics.
