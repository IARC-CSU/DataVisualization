During discussions with key stakeholders, a model was selected that aims to capitalize on the expertise available in several countries through a shared mechanism. The approach calls for a central coordinating centre (INC \/ Argentina) acting in conjunction with \u2018contributing centres\u2019 to collectively deliver the activities for the Hub. A Steering Committee from the relevant organizations would serve as a means to provide local oversight for this model.\r\n\r\nThe coordinating centre for the Hub is based in the National Cancer Institute (INC) of Argentina in Buenos Aires. The Hub provides assistance to the 19 Spanish and Portuguese speaking countries in North America (Mexico), Central America (Costa Rica; Cuba; El Salvador; Guatemala; Honduras; Nicaragua; Panama) and South America (Argentina; Bolivia; Brazil; Chile; Colombia; Ecuador; Paraguay; Peru; Uruguay; Venezuela).\r\n\r\nCollaborative centres are being selected to provide technical expertise and experience, with consideration to other factors such as a balance between cancer registries and national cancer institutes. Collaborative centres will be expected to provide mentorship and contribute to training activities. Initially, three to four centres will be designated as \u2018collaborating centres.\u2019 The region also benefits from established cancer registry networks. Notably, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) along with the consortium groups REDEPICAN and the Network of National Cancer Institutes -RINC (Red de Institutos Nacionales de C\u00e1ncer). \u00a0They have acted to deliver support to the region.\r\n\r\nThe Ibero-American Network of Cancer Epidemiology and Information Systems (REDEPICAN) was created in 1984 through a broad cooperation agreement between 19 Latin American countries, Spain and Portugal. The overall objective of REDEPICAN is to facilitate collaboration for cancer epidemiology and information systems among Ibero-American countries. Similarly, the RINC cancer registry working group, based in Brazil, has a mandate to promote the development of cancer surveillance systems for the RINC countries, with the purpose to broaden knowledge on cancer burden for appropriate cancer control actions. Discussions regarding the integration of efforts between the Hub and these groups will be an essential element of the development of the Hub.\r\n\r\nHigh-quality PBCR at the national level are available in two countries (Costa Rica and Uruguay), although there are regional equivalents in many countries including organized networks of registries in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Ecuador alongside regional registries in Cuba and Peru.

During discussions with key stakeholders, a model was selected that aims to capitalize on the expertise available in several countries through a shared mechanism. The approach calls for a central coordinating centre (INC \/ Argentina) acting in conjunction with \u2018contributing centres\u2019 to collectively deliver the activities for the Hub. A Steering Committee from the relevant organizations would serve as a means to provide local oversight for this model.\r\n\r\nThe coordinating centre for the Hub is based in the National Cancer Institute (INC) of Argentina in Buenos Aires. The Hub provides assistance to the 19 Spanish and Portuguese speaking countries in North America (Mexico), Central America (Costa Rica; Cuba; El Salvador; Guatemala; Honduras; Nicaragua; Panama) and South America (Argentina; Bolivia; Brazil; Chile; Colombia; Ecuador; Paraguay; Peru; Uruguay; Venezuela).\r\n\r\nCollaborative centres are being selected to provide technical expertise and experience, with consideration to other factors such as a balance between cancer registries and national cancer institutes. Collaborative centres will be expected to provide mentorship and contribute to training activities. Initially, three to four centres will be designated as \u2018collaborating centres.\u2019 The region also benefits from established cancer registry networks. Notably, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) along with the consortium groups REDEPICAN and the Network of National Cancer Institutes -RINC (Red de Institutos Nacionales de C\u00e1ncer). \u00a0They have acted to deliver support to the region.\r\n\r\nThe Ibero-American Network of Cancer Epidemiology and Information Systems (REDEPICAN) was created in 1984 through a broad cooperation agreement between 19 Latin American countries, Spain and Portugal. The overall objective of REDEPICAN is to facilitate collaboration for cancer epidemiology and information systems among Ibero-American countries. Similarly, the RINC cancer registry working group, based in Brazil, has a mandate to promote the development of cancer surveillance systems for the RINC countries, with the purpose to broaden knowledge on cancer burden for appropriate cancer control actions.

established during 2012 by an agreement with the African Cancer Registry Network (AFCRN), acting as a consortium to provide Hub activities for PBCR in Sub Saharan Africa. While all registries in countries within the region are eligible for AFCRN membership, the registry must be population-based, achieving at least 50% coverage of the target population and invited to join following a consultant visit of evaluation. The role of INCTR is provision of a secretariat and coordinating centre for the Network, which assists in implementing the programme of activities for the Hub.\r\n\r\nThe activities of the African network are guided by the advisory group (steering committee). The current members are: Jean-Marie Dangou (Regional Advisor on non-Communicable Diseases, WHO-AFRO); Dr Anne Korir (regional representative for Africa, IACR); Freddie Bray (Head of Cancer Surveillance Section, IARC); and Julie Torode (Director Advocacy and Programmes \/ Deputy CEO, UICC).\r\n\r\nThe Hub covers 48 countries in the four regions of sub-Saharan Africa: East Africa (Burundi; Comoros; Djibouti; Eritrea; Ethiopia; Kenya; Madagascar; Malawi; Mauritius; Mozambique; Rwanda; Seychelles; Somalia; South Sudan; Tanzania; Uganda; Zambia; Zimbabwe), Middle Africa (Angola; Cameroon; Central African Republic; Chad; Congo, Democratic Republic; Congo, Republic of; Equatorial Guinea; Gabon), Southern Africa (Botswana; Lesotho; Namibia; South African Republic; Swaziland) and West Africa (Benin; Burkina Faso; Cape Verde; Cote d'Ivoire; The Gambia; Ghana; Guinea-Bissau; Guinea; Liberia; Mali; Mauritania; Niger; Nigeria; Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal; Sierra Leone; Togo).\r\n\r\nThe longstanding high-quality registries in the region are in Uganda (Kampala) and Zimbabwe (Harare), with Malawi (Blantyre) and the South African Republic (RSA) acquiring CI5 status in the last Volume, the latter (the PROMEC registry) covering the rural 1.3 million population in the former-Transkei region of the Eastern Cape Province. The countries where PBCR are developing and producing data include highly-populated Nigeria in the North, Kenya, Ethiopia and Tanzania in the East, the Gambia and Guinea in the West, while there are efforts to start an expansion of PBCR in RSA and Mozambique. There are a considerable number of registry developments ongoing within the 22 present AFCRN members across 19 countries, although there remains some 18 countries in the region where there are no data or the status of registration is presently unknown (Figure 5: Registration status in the Sub Saharan Africa Hub).\r\n\r\nFor Further information:\r\nINCTR,\r\nAfrican Cancer Registry Programme,\r\nPrama House,\r\n267 Banbury Road,\r\nOxford,\r\nOX2 7HT,\r\nUK&lt;br\/&gt;\r\nEmail: admin@afcrn.org\r\nhttp:\/\/afcrn.org","pi":"Dr. Max Parkin\r\nHonorary Senior Research Fellow, Oxford University\r\nSenior Visiting Scientist, IARC\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Dr Donald Maxwell (Max) Parkin was born in 1944, and graduated summa cum laude in medicine at Edinburgh University in 1968, where he later took an MD (1985).

During discussions with key stakeholders, a model was selected that aims to capitalize on the expertise available in several countries through a shared mechanism. The approach calls for a central coordinating centre (INC \/ Argentina) acting in conjunction with \u2018contributing centres\u2019 to collectively deliver the activities for the Hub. A Steering Committee from the relevant organizations would serve as a means to provide local oversight for this model.\r\n\r\nThe coordinating centre for the Hub is based in the National Cancer Institute (INC) of Argentina in Buenos Aires. The Hub provides assistance to the 19 Spanish and Portuguese speaking countries in North America (Mexico), Central America (Costa Rica; Cuba; El Salvador; Guatemala; Honduras; Nicaragua; Panama) and South America (Argentina; Bolivia; Brazil; Chile; Colombia; Ecuador; Paraguay; Peru; Uruguay; Venezuela).\r\n\r\nCollaborative centres are being selected to provide technical expertise and experience, with consideration to other factors such as a balance between cancer registries and national cancer institutes. Collaborative centres will be expected to provide mentorship and contribute to training activities. Initially, three to four centres will be designated as \u2018collaborating centres.\u2019 The region also benefits from established cancer registry networks. Notably, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) along with the consortium groups REDEPICAN and the Network of National Cancer Institutes -RINC (Red de Institutos Nacionales de C\u00e1ncer). \u00a0They have acted to deliver support to the region.\r\n\r\nThe Ibero-American Network of Cancer Epidemiology and Information Systems (REDEPICAN) was created in 1984 through a broad cooperation agreement between 19 Latin American countries, Spain and Portugal. The overall objective of REDEPICAN is to facilitate collaboration for cancer epidemiology and information systems among Ibero-American countries. Similarly, the RINC cancer registry working group, based in Brazil, has a mandate to promote the development of cancer surveillance systems for the RINC countries, with the purpose to broaden knowledge on cancer burden for appropriate cancer control actions. Discussions regarding the integration of efforts between the Hub and these groups will be an essential element of the development of the Hub.\r\n\r\nHigh-quality PBCR at the national level are available in two countries (Costa Rica and Uruguay), although there are regional equivalents in many countries including organized networks of registries in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Ecuador alongside regional registries in Cuba and Peru.

IARC Regional Hub for Cancer Registration for Latin America was established in 2014. During discussions with key stakeholders, a model was selected that aims to capitalize on the expertise available in several countries through a shared mechanism. The approach calls for a central coordinating centre (INC \/ Argentina) acting in conjunction with \u2018contributing centres\u2019 to collectively deliver the activities for the Hub. A Steering Committee from the relevant organizations would serve as a means to provide local oversight for this model.\r\n\r\nThe coordinating centre for the Hub is based in the National Cancer Institute (INC) of Argentina in Buenos Aires. The Hub provides assistance to the 19 Spanish and Portuguese speaking countries in North America (Mexico), Central America (Costa Rica; Cuba; El Salvador; Guatemala; Honduras; Nicaragua; Panama) and South America (Argentina; Bolivia; Brazil; Chile; Colombia; Ecuador; Paraguay; Peru; Uruguay; Venezuela).\r\n\r\nCollaborative centres are being selected to provide technical expertise and experience, with consideration to other factors such as a balance between cancer registries and national cancer institutes. Collaborative centres will be expected to provide mentorship and contribute to training activities. Initially, three to four centres will be designated as \u2018collaborating centres.\u2019 The region also benefits from established cancer registry networks. Notably, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) along with the consortium groups REDEPICAN and the Network of National Cancer Institutes -RINC (Red de Institutos Nacionales de C\u00e1ncer). \u00a0They have acted to deliver support to the region.\r\n\r\nThe Ibero-American Network of Cancer Epidemiology and Information Systems (REDEPICAN) was created in 1984 through a broad cooperation agreement between 19 Latin American countries, Spain and Portugal. The overall objective of REDEPICAN is to facilitate collaboration for cancer epidemiology and information systems among Ibero-American countries. Similarly, the RINC cancer registry working group, based in Brazil, has a mandate to promote the development of cancer surveillance systems for the RINC countries, with the purpose to broaden knowledge on cancer burden for appropriate cancer control actions. Discussions regarding the integration of efforts between the Hub and these groups will be an essential element of the development of the Hub.\r\n\r\nHigh-quality PBCR at the national level are available in two countries (Costa Rica and Uruguay), although there are regional equivalents in many countries including organized networks of registries in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Ecuador alongside regional registries in Cuba and Peru. There also ongoing efforts to establish PBCR in Bolivia, Guatemala, Mexico and Paraguay.

America was established in 2014. During discussions with key stakeholders, a model was selected that aims to capitalize on the expertise available in several countries through a shared mechanism. The approach calls for a central coordinating centre (INC \/ Argentina) acting in conjunction with \u2018contributing centres\u2019 to collectively deliver the activities for the Hub. A Steering Committee from the relevant organizations would serve as a means to provide local oversight for this model.\r\n\r\nThe coordinating centre for the Hub is based in the National Cancer Institute (INC) of Argentina in Buenos Aires. The Hub provides assistance to the 19 Spanish and Portuguese speaking countries in North America (Mexico), Central America (Costa Rica; Cuba; El Salvador; Guatemala; Honduras; Nicaragua; Panama) and South America (Argentina; Bolivia; Brazil; Chile; Colombia; Ecuador; Paraguay; Peru; Uruguay; Venezuela).\r\n\r\nCollaborative centres are being selected to provide technical expertise and experience, with consideration to other factors such as a balance between cancer registries and national cancer institutes. Collaborative centres will be expected to provide mentorship and contribute to training activities. Initially, three to four centres will be designated as \u2018collaborating centres.\u2019 The region also benefits from established cancer registry networks. Notably, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) along with the consortium groups REDEPICAN and the Network of National Cancer Institutes -RINC (Red de Institutos Nacionales de C\u00e1ncer). \u00a0They have acted to deliver support to the region.\r\n\r\nThe Ibero-American Network of Cancer Epidemiology and Information Systems (REDEPICAN) was created in 1984 through a broad cooperation agreement between 19 Latin American countries, Spain and Portugal. The overall objective of REDEPICAN is to facilitate collaboration for cancer epidemiology and information systems among Ibero-American countries. Similarly, the RINC cancer registry working group, based in Brazil, has a mandate to promote the development of cancer surveillance systems for the RINC countries, with the purpose to broaden knowledge on cancer burden for appropriate cancer control actions. Discussions regarding the integration of efforts between the Hub and these groups will be an essential element of the development of the Hub.\r\n\r\nHigh-quality PBCR at the national level are available in two countries (Costa Rica and Uruguay), although there are regional equivalents in many countries including organized networks of registries in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Ecuador alongside regional registries in Cuba and Peru.

On average, 1,500 patients visit every day and every year, about 25,000 new cancer patients are registered with the hospital.\r\n\r\nTMC has a longstanding history as a recognized training centre. TMC also serves as a post-graduate teaching centre, affiliated with the Homi Bhabha National Institute (HBNI) (Deemed University) offering post-graduate degrees.\r\n\r\nCancer registry activities at TMC have been active through collaborations with local, national and international partners for over fifty years. With dedicated staff, facilities available to the Hub include lecture halls, office space for extended visits and large computer labs for use in practical assignments.\r\n\r\nThe Mumbai Hub is the first point of call for registries in the region to respond to all queries on cancer registration. The Hub will provide support to cancer registries across the 25 countries in East Asia (China; Japan; Korea, Democratic People's Republic; Korea, Republic of; Mongolia), South-East Asia (Brunei Darussalam; Cambodia; Indonesia; Lao People Democratic Republic; Malaysia; Myanmar; Philippines; Singapore; Thailand; Timor-Leste; Viet Nam) and South Asia (Afghanistan; Bangladesh; Bhutan; India; Iran, Islamic Republic of; Maldives; Nepal; Pakistan; Sri Lanka).\r\n\r\nCurrently, PBCR deemed as high quality exist in eight countries (Figure 4: Registration status in the Mumbai Hub).\r\n\r\nFor Further information:\r\nEast, South-East and South Asia IARC Regional Hub (Mumbai)\r\nCentre for Cancer Epidemiology\r\nAnnex Building, 6th Floor, Tata Memorial Hospital\r\nTel: +91 022 24177123 Fax: 91 022 24146937\r\nEmail: tataiarc@gmail.com\r\nhttp:\/\/tmcepi.gov.in","pi":"Dr. Rajesh Dikshit\r\nHead, Epidemiology, Tata Memorial Hospital","canreg_experts":"Nikhil B.

During discussions with key stakeholders, a model was selected that aims to capitalize on the expertise available in several countries through a shared mechanism. The approach calls for a central coordinating centre (INC \/ Argentina) acting in conjunction with \u2018contributing centres\u2019 to collectively deliver the activities for the Hub. A Steering Committee from the relevant organizations would serve as a means to provide local oversight for this model.\r\n\r\nThe coordinating centre for the Hub is based in the National Cancer Institute (INC) of Argentina in Buenos Aires. The Hub provides assistance to the 19 Spanish and Portuguese speaking countries in North America (Mexico), Central America (Costa Rica; Cuba; El Salvador; Guatemala; Honduras; Nicaragua; Panama) and South America (Argentina; Bolivia; Brazil; Chile; Colombia; Ecuador; Paraguay; Peru; Uruguay; Venezuela).\r\n\r\nCollaborative centres are being selected to provide technical expertise and experience, with consideration to other factors such as a balance between cancer registries and national cancer institutes. Collaborative centres will be expected to provide mentorship and contribute to training activities. Initially, three to four centres will be designated as \u2018collaborating centres.\u2019 The region also benefits from established cancer registry networks. Notably, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) along with the consortium groups REDEPICAN and the Network of National Cancer Institutes -RINC (Red de Institutos Nacionales de C\u00e1ncer). \u00a0They have acted to deliver support to the region.\r\n\r\nThe Ibero-American Network of Cancer Epidemiology and Information Systems (REDEPICAN) was created in 1984 through a broad cooperation agreement between 19 Latin American countries, Spain and Portugal. The overall objective of REDEPICAN is to facilitate collaboration for cancer epidemiology and information systems among Ibero-American countries. Similarly, the RINC cancer registry working group, based in Brazil, has a mandate to promote the development of cancer surveillance systems for the RINC countries, with the purpose to broaden knowledge on cancer burden for appropriate cancer control actions.

A Steering Committee from the relevant organizations would serve as a means to provide local oversight for this model.\r\n\r\nThe coordinating centre for the Hub is based in the National Cancer Institute (INC) of Argentina in Buenos Aires. The Hub provides assistance to the 19 Spanish and Portuguese speaking countries in North America (Mexico), Central America (Costa Rica; Cuba; El Salvador; Guatemala; Honduras; Nicaragua; Panama) and South America (Argentina; Bolivia; Brazil; Chile; Colombia; Ecuador; Paraguay; Peru; Uruguay; Venezuela).\r\n\r\nCollaborative centres are being selected to provide technical expertise and experience, with consideration to other factors such as a balance between cancer registries and national cancer institutes. Collaborative centres will be expected to provide mentorship and contribute to training activities. Initially, three to four centres will be designated as \u2018collaborating centres.\u2019 The region also benefits from established cancer registry networks.
