Mumbai was inaugurated at the Tata Memorial Centre (TMC) in Mumbai, India in 2012 as the first Regional Hub for Cancer Registration established under the GICR. TMC is a national comprehensive cancer centre, the largest cancer hospital in Asia, with more than 40,000 new patient visits annually from all over India and neighboring countries. On average, 1,500 patients visit every day and every year, about 25,000 new cancer patients are registered with the hospital. 

TMC has a longstanding history as a recognized training centre. TMC also serves as a post-graduate teaching centre, affiliated with the Homi Bhabha National Institute (HBNI) (Deemed University) offering post-graduate degrees. 

Cancer registry activities at TMC have been active through collaborations with local, national and international partners for over fifty years. With dedicated staff, facilities available to the Hub include lecture halls, office space for extended visits and large computer labs for use in practical assignments. 

The Mumbai Hub is the first point of call for registries in the region to respond to all queries on cancer registration. The Hub will provide support to cancer registries across the 25 countries in East Asia (China; Japan; Korea, Democratic People's Republic; Korea, Republic of; Mongolia), South-East Asia (Brunei Darussalam; Cambodia; Indonesia; Lao People Democratic Republic; Malaysia; Myanmar; Philippines; Singapore; Thailand; Timor-Leste; Viet Nam) and South Asia (Afghanistan; Bangladesh; Bhutan; India; Iran, Islamic Republic of; Maldives; Nepal; Pakistan; Sri Lanka). 

Currently, PBCR deemed as high quality exist in eight countries (Figure 4: Registration status in the Mumbai Hub).
